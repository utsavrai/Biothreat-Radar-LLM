# Biothreat-Radar-LLM

Biothreat-Radar-LLM is a project that leverages the capabilities of the LLM Gemini Pro to analyze over 1000 news articles and provide real-time insights into emerging biothreats. This repository contains the code and resources needed to understand and replicate the project.

## Overview

### Objectives
The primary goal of Biothreat-Radar-LLM is to empower decision-makers by providing:
- **Real-time actionable insights**: Keeping stakeholders informed about potential health threats as they emerge.
- **Public sentiment analysis**: Understanding how the public perceives ongoing health threats.
- **Data transparency and reliability**: Ensuring the information provided is both transparent and reliable.
- **Health data integration**: Structuring data to maximize its impact on decision-making processes.

## Features
1. **News Article Analysis**: Uses LLM Gemini Pro to process and analyze over 1000 news articles related to biothreats.
2. **Sentiment Communication**: Captures and communicates public sentiment regarding health threats.
3. **Real-time Updates**: Provides continuous, up-to-date insights into emerging biothreats.
4. **Reliability Indicators**: Includes indicators to assess the reliability of the information presented.
5. **Chatbot Assistant**: Offers a chatbot for users to ask further questions and get detailed information.

## Why This Project?
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of being prepared for health threats. The UK Public Accounts Committee noted that the government was underprepared for such an event. Recent models predict a 47-57% likelihood of a similar pandemic occurring within the next 25 years. The Biothreat-Radar-LLM aims to bridge this preparedness gap by providing timely and accurate information.
